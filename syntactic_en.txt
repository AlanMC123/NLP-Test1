When lawyer Cui Chen recalled his first pet-related case, his tone turned reflective.

It was February this year, and the dispute involved a client who had entrusted two cats, a mother and her offspring, to a pet sitter found on the social media app Xiaohongshu, or RedNote. Just three days into the boarding period, both cats fell from a 19th floor and died.

"The emotional toll on the owner was immense. Those cats had been with him since they were kittens. He was devastated," Cui said. The case never made it to court. Instead, Cui helped negotiate a settlement worth a few thousand yuan, paid out in small monthly installments by the sitter, a recent university graduate who claimed financial hardship.
